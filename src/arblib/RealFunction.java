  /**
   * <code>
   * Rigorously isolates single roots of a real analytic function on the interior of an interval.
   * 
   * This routine writes an array of n interesting subintervals of interval to found and corresponding flags to flags, returning the integer n. 
   * 
   * The output has the following properties: 
   * 
   * 1. The function has no roots on interval outside of the output subintervals.
   * 
   * 2. Subintervals are sorted in increasing order (with no overlap except possibly starting and ending with the same point).
   * 
   * 3. Subintervals with a flag of 1 contain exactly one (single) root.
   * 
   * 4. Subintervals with any other flag may or may not contain roots.
   * 
   * 5. If no flags other than 1 occur, all roots of the function on interval have been isolated.
   *  
   * If there are output subintervals on which the existence or nonexistence of roots could not be determined, 
   * further searches on those subintervals may be attempted with possibly with increased precision and/or increased bounds for 
   * the breaking criteria. 
   * 
   * Note that roots of multiplicity higher than one and roots located exactly at endpoints cannot be isolated by the this function.
   
   * The following breaking criteria are implemented:
   * At most maxdepth recursive subdivisions are attempted. 
   * The smallest details that can be distinguished are therefore about maxdepth times the width of interval. 
   * 
   * The total number of calls to func is thereby restricted to a small multiple of maxeval (the actual count can be slightly higher depending on implementation details). 
   * </code>
   * 
   * Warning: it is assumed that subdivision points of interval can be represented
   * exactly as floating-point numbers in memory. Do not pass as input.
   * 1+/-2^(-10^(100))
   * 
   * @param found    upon return this is populated with an array of n interesting
   *                 subintervals of interval
   * @param flags    flags corresponding to the found subintervals
   * @param interval the region with which to isolate the roots
   * @param maxdepth A typical, reasonable value might be between 20 and 50.
   * @param maxeval  If the total number of tested subintervals exceeds maxeval,
   *                 the algorithm is terminated and any untested subintervals are
   *                 added to the output. A typical, reasonable value might be
   *                 between 100 and 100000.
   * @param maxfound The algorithm terminates if maxfound roots have been
   *                 isolated. In particular, setting maxfound to 1 can be used to
   *                 locate just one root of the function even if there are
   *                 numerous roots. To try to find all roots, LONG_MAX may be
   *                 passed.
   * @param prec     denotes the precision used to evaluate the function. It is
   *                 possibly also used for some other arithmetic operations
   *                 performed internally by the algorithm. Note that it probably
   *                 does not make sense for maxdepth to exceed prec.
