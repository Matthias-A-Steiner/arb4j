  abstract            = {Following G. M. Reed's definition of a $Q$-set, we define a $Q_A$-set to be any non-$\sigma$-discrete topological space with the property that each subset is (relatively) analytic (= Souslin-$\mathscr{F}$ set). Clearly every $Q$-set is a $Q_A$-set. The discrete irrational extension of the space of real numbers is an example of a first countable hereditarily paracompact (Hausdorff) $Q_A$-set which is not a $Q$-set. THEOREM. $(V = L)$ Let $X$ be a first countable normal space all of whose subsets are analytic. Then $X$ is $\sigma$-discrete if and only if the product of $X$ with the space of irrational numbers is normal. A new structural property of analytic sets is developed in order to utilize a proof technique due to Reed. Several corollaries are obtained on properties of completely additive-analytic families of sets in general metric spaces.},

We define predictability for random processes indexed byX and for random measures onX and prove the existence and uniqueness of predictable and dual predictable projections under a regularity condition on Φ. ForX=ℝ 2 + and under monotonicity assumptions on the sets Γx we will identify the predictable projections of some simple processes as regular versions of certain martingales.},

Using this general dynamic model, which allows (a) intradaily returns to have different impacts and persistence on stock-return volatility, (b) return effects on volatility to be asymmetric, and (c) intradaily returns to follow conditional distributions with different fourth moments, we uncover important changes in return dynamics and conditional fourth moments following Big Bang and the 1987 crash not reported before.},

Explicit demand functions for assets are derived, and it is shown that, unlike the one-period model, current demands are affected by the possibility of uncertain changes in future investment opportunities. After aggregating demands and requiring market clearing, the equilibrium relationships among expected returns are derived, and contrary to the classical capital asset pricing model, expected returns on risky assets may differ from the riskless rate even when they have no systematic or market risk.},

The challenge is to construct a sequence of functions, each based on only finite segments of the past, which together provide a strongly consistent estimator for the conditional probability of the next observation, given the infinite past. Ornstein gave such a construction for the case that the values are from a finite set, and recently Algoet extended the scheme to time series with coordinates in a Polish space. The present study relates a different solution to the challenge. The algorithm is simple and its verification is fairly transparent. Some extensions to regression, pattern recognition and on-line forecasting are mentioned.},

  abstract = {We describe a semiclassical method to calculate universal transport properties of chaotic cavities. While the energy-averaged conductance turns out governed by pairs of entrance-to-exit trajectories, the conductance variance, shot noise and other related quantities require trajectory quadruplets; simple diagrammatic rules allow us to find the contributions of these pairs and quadruplets. Both pure symmetry classes and the crossover due to an external magnetic field are considered. },

We derive a canonical algorithm to obtain this holomorphic representation and in particular explicitly compute it for quantum gravity in terms of a Wick rotation transform.},

We model the arrival of mid-price changes in the E-mini S&P futures contract as a self-exciting Hawkes process. Using several estimation methods, we find that the Hawkes kernel is power-law with a decay exponent close to −1.15 at short times, less than ≈ 103 s, and crosses over to a second power-law regime with a larger decay exponent ≈–1.45 for longer times scales in the range [103 ,106 ] seconds. More importantly, we find that the Hawkes kernel integrates to unity independently of the analysed period, from 1998 to 2011. This suggests that markets are and have always been close to criticality, challenging a recent study which indicates that reflexivity (endogeneity) has increased in recent years as a result of increased automation of trading. However, we note that the scale over which market events are correlated has decreased steadily over time with the emergence of higher frequency trading.

  abstract = {This paper proposes a method for constructing a volatility risk premium, or investor risk aversion, index. The method is intuitive and simple to implement, relying on the sample moments of the recently popularized model-free realized and option-implied volatility measures. A small-scale Monte Carlo experiment confirms that the procedure works well in practice. Implementing the procedure with actual S&P500 option-implied volatilities and high-frequency five-minute-based realized volatilities indicates significant temporal dependencies in the estimated stochastic volatility risk premium, which we in turn relate to a set of macro-finance state variables. We also find that the extracted volatility risk premium helps predict future stock market returns.},

  abstract             = {Ergodic theory is hard to study because it is based on measure theory, which is a technically difficult subject to master for ordinary students, especially for physics majors. Many of the examples are introduced from a different perspective than in other books and theoretical ideas can be gradually absorbed while doing computer experiments. Theoretically less prepared students can appreciate the deep theorems by doing various simulations. The computer experiments are simple but they have close ties with theoretical implications. Even the researchers in the field can benefit by checking their conjectures, which might have been regarded as unrealistic to be programmed easily, against numerical output using some of the ideas in the book. One last remark: The last chapter explains the relation between entropy and data compression, which belongs to information theory and not to ergodic theory. It will help students to gain an understanding of the digital technology that has shaped the modern information society.},
